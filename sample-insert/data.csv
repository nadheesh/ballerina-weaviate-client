When you publish an API, you can also publish a connector for that API to make it available on the Choreo Marketplace.","https://console.choreo.dev/organizations/{organization}/projects/{project_id}/components/{component_id}/manage/lifecycle?profile=default","['organization','project_id','component_id']"
"Manage Choreo API","Consumers","The Consumers pane shows us the applications that have subscribed to your API.

"Manage Choreo API","Permissions","Permissions allow you to attach scopes that enable fine-grained access control to your API resources. You can create a scope entry by giving a scope name. You can then select and apply these scopes to the individual resources in your API. On the identity provider, a scope will have a role mapped to it. A role specifies the permissions associated with it. When you invoke the API resource with a specific scope, the access to your API resource is controlled based on the permissions associated with the role.","https://console.choreo.dev/organizations/{organization}/projects/{project_id}/components/{component_id}/manage/scopes?profile=default","['organization','project_id','component_id']"
